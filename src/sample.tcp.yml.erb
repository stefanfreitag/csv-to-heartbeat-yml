  # Entries can be:
  #   - plain host name or IP like `localhost`:
  #       Requires ports configs to be checked. If ssl is configured,
  #       a SSL/TLS based connection will be established. Otherwise plain tcp connection
  #       will be established
  #   - hostname + port like `localhost:12345`:
  #       Connect to port on given host. If ssl is configured,
  #       a SSL/TLS based connection will be established. Otherwise plain tcp connection
  #       will be established
  #   - full url syntax. `scheme://<host>:[port]`. The `<scheme>` can be one of
  #     `tcp`, `plain`, `ssl` and `tls`. If `tcp`, `plain` is configured, a plain
  #     tcp connection will be established, even if ssl is configured.
  #     Using `tls`/`ssl`, an SSL connection is established. If no ssl is configured,
  #     system defaults will be used (not supported on windows).
  #     If `port` is missing in url, the ports setting is required.
